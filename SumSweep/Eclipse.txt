To run this folder in an Eclipse project, it is necessary to perform the following steps:
1) Make sure that JVM 7 is installed (the project is not compatible with previous Java versions).
2) Copy this whole folder inside your Eclipse Workspace.
3) Open Eclipse.
4) Click File-New-Java Project.
5) Enter the name of this folder (SumSweep if it has not been renamed) in the field "Project name".
6) Click Finish.
7) Test the project: if it does not work, continue through steps 8-13.
8) Right-click on the project and choose Properties.
9) Open Java Build Path/Libraries and add all libraries in folder JarLibraries, if they are not present.
10) Check that the library JUnit 4 is present: if not, add it through the button "Add library".
11) Check the JRE System Library (should be at least Java 7).
12) Click on Java Compiler on the left, and set the same Compiler compliance level as the JRE System Lybrary in point 11.
13) Now the library should work.
